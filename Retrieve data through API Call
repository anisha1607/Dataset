# The aim of this assignment is to understand the various data sources and retrieve the 
# data from them, through web scraping or by using an API. I have collected data using API call
# on news articles from the website “newsapi.org”  on 2 of the most trending topics in the world: 
# terrorism in Afghanistan and Corona virus. Data has been collected from 18th Aug 2021 to 29th Aug 2021
# and saved in a CSV file for further pre-processing and data-modelling.
